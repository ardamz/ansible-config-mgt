# Ansible â€“ Automate Project 7 to 10

## STEP 1.  **Install and Configure Ansible on EC2 Instance**

1. Still maintaining my infrastructure from the last project, I changed the name of the `Jenkins Server`  to `Jenkins-Ansible`. This will be use to run the ansible playbooks.

2. I installed ansible on the server and checked the version of ansible installed by running the following lines of code;

 ```bash 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible -y

# Check version of Ansible
ansible --version
```

3. In my `guthub` account, I created a new repositiry named `ansible-config-mgt`.

4. I configured `Jenkins` by perfor,ming the following steps;
    *  I created a new Freestyle project called `ansible` in Jenkins and pointed it to my `ansible-config-mgt` repository.
    -  I configured Webhook in GitHub and set webhook to trigger `ansible` build.
    *  I configured a Post-build job to save all (**) files.
    
5. I tested my setup by making some changes to the main branch and made sure that builds starts automatically and Jenkins saved the files (build artifacts) as shown below;

## STEP 2.  **Prepare the Development Environment using Visual Studio Code (VSC)**

1. VSC was configured to connect to my `ansible-config-mgt` repository.

2. i then cloned the `ansible-config-mgt` repository to my Jenkins-AAnsible Instance.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ardamz/ansible-config-mgt.git
```

## STEP 3.  **Begin Ansible Developement**

1. I created a new branch called `prj-11` in my `ansible-config-mgt` repository.

```bash
# Checkout and create a branch called prj-11
git checkout -b prj-11

# Create both playbooks and inventory directories
mkdir playboks && mkdir inventory

# Create common.yml in playbooks directory
cd playboks && touch common.yml

```

2. I created `playbooks` (used to store all your playbook files) and `inventotory` (used to keep your hosts organised) directories.

3. Created a `common.yml` file in the `playbooks` directory.

 ```bash 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev -y

#Confirm Apache is running
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

2. I updated the apache config file by running.
 ```bash 
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```
and inserted the following lines of code

```bash
<Proxy "balancer://mycluster">
               BalancerMember http://172.31.84.98:80 loadfactor=5 timeout=1
               BalancerMember http://172.31.89.6:80 loadfactor=5 timeout=1
               ProxySet lbmethod=bytraffic
               # ProxySet lbmethod=byrequests
        </Proxy>

        ProxyPreserveHost On
        ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/
        ProxyPassReverse / balancer://mycluster/
```
>To effect this changes, I restarted the apache service `sudo systemctl restart apache2`

3. I verified my setup thus far by putting the public IP address of the LoadBalancer in the browser and voila!!!

4. On each of the web-servers, I unmounted the logs directory from the `/mnt/logs` directory on the NFS Server by running;
```bash
sudo umount -l /var/log/httpd
```
> used the -l as it was returning a mount point busy error.

5. I restarted both servers and anytime i refreshed webpage of the loadbalancer  I was able to read their access logs (increasing in turns) by running 
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log
```

NOTES: This was an interesting one as i learnt of the various Load balancing comcepts and some scenarios where they can be deployed.
